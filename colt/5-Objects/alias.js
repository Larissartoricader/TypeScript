// Alias is the definition of types for objects before we even write the values of the objects. It is like a definition, how th object should be declare when it happens.
// Now I can user Person a TYPE for my code. I do not need to specify every single type of key, because this information is already declared inside the new created type Person, an Alias Type of TS.
